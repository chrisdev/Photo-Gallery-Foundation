I am in the middle of getting the click event to work on the polaroids.

The click seems to be detected, but the wiring for the gallery does not work.

I need to be careful on the structure of the HTML since a previous version 
for some reason rendered with unbalanced divs and both the mainDiv and the 
galleryDiv were NESTED rather than SIBLINGS.
